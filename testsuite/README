Welcome to the test suite for the SWAzam software project of group 9.

In order to start our project, you need:
  .) MongoDB, downloadable at http://www.mongodb.org/downloads
  .) Maven in the classpath

Please execute 1-startservers.bat first. This script starts the MongoDB and a Tomcat instance.
In this file you need to provide the path to your MongoDB installation directory (including "/bin").

Then execute 2-startpeers.bat. There, the five peers and a management console for them are started.

Finally using 3a-startclient.bat you can start the client GUI to start issuing requests.
You can log in using any credentials as used for the peers (see 2-startpeers.bat).

Alternatively you can start 3b-issuetestrequest.bat to use the client console and launch a request.
