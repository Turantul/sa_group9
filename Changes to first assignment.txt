The only major change we did in comparison to the first assignment is the order of request processing at a peers site.
Instead of calculating a match and deciding on the outcome whether to forward the request to neighbor peers or not, the request
is forwarded immideately.

This has some performance improvements as the flooding speeds up and more peers are reached faster. However, the load at one
peer does not significantly increase because it checks whether it has already processed a request.
